## Day 1

We have a list of numbers, and need to find some of them who sum to 2020

### Part A

Find 2 numbers who sum to 2020, then return their product

### Part B

Find 3 numbers who sum to 2020, then return their product

### Tests

None for this one currently.

### Additional thoughts?

I was passing the data into the function twice, and only cared about reading it, so needed to use a reference.

Could I have converted to an iter before I sent it to the function? Then no move would have happened? Worth a try
