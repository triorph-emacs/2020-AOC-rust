Day 6

Simple hashset work, although a little bit of wringing around getting the syntax of unions/intersections right
(they're not actually the same object, so have to do a mildly awkward conversion back to a HashSet after each operation).

Got the first one mostly working before I even wrote the unit tests for it. Data structures could probably do some work, 
but mostly I was just feeling a little rusty with my rust, so needed to get back in the groove, and thankfully this was
a very easy exercise for it.
