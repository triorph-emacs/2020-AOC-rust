### Day 5

A nice easy one. If I remember correctly I just replaced R and B with 1, and L and F with 0
and used the python binary parsing mode to get the real seat number.

For rust I used a more simple method where I add 1 or 0, then bit-shift by 1 and keep going.

Has unit tests, but not a lot to show for itself. Was a very easy day.
